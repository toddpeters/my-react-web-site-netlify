# Change Log
### Warning
**The following warnings may appear when running the installation command, but they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product:**
```
npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm WARN deprecated popper.js@1.16.1: Popper changed home, find its new releases at @popperjs/core
npm WARN deprecated core-js@2.6.11: core-js@<3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js@3.
```
**The folowing components make react throw errors for using life-cycle methods that will be dropped in React 17.x: react-datetime, react-bootstrap-switch. But the UI or functionality of the product is not affected.
```
Warning: componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https://fb.me/react-unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.

* Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate.
* If you're updating state whenever props change, refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps. Learn more at: https://fb.me/react-derived-state
* Rename componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps to suppress this warning in non-strict mode. In React 17.x, only the UNSAFE_ name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.

Please update the following components: DateTime, Switch
```
- Added Reactstrap as base framework
